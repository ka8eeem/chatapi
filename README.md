# Application Logic

Itâ€™s required to build a chat system. The system should allow creating new applications where each application will have a token(generated by the system) and a name(provided by the client). The token is the identifier that devices use to send chats to that application.

Each application can have many chats. a chat should have a number. Numbering of chats in each application starts from 1 and no 2 chats in the same application may have the same number. The number of the chat should be returned in the chat creation request. 

A chat contains messages and messages have numbers that start from 1 for each chat. The number of the message should also be returned in the message creation request. The client should never see the ID of any of the entities. The client identifies the application by its token and the chat by its number along with the application token.

# Requirements

* Building the API. No GUI is required.
* Using Ruby on Rails(V5) for building the API and the workers.
* Using mysql as our main datastore
* Using rabbitmq as queuing system to avoid race condition
* Using elasticsearch to search the messages body
* Using `docker-compose up` to wrap and run the whole stack

# Approach

as its my first time using RoR i started with a quick [crash course](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/ruby-rails-big-picture)

1) initialized the application boilerplate using `rails new chatApp --api -d mysql`
2) generate migration and models using `rails generate model Application`
